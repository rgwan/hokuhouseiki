A microcode-based 8051-ISA(temporary) soft processor optimized for high frequency (not high speed), small footprint on low-end FPGAs.

It is a test project for me. I want to learn microsequencer - microcode based processor design, so I create this project.

Currently working in progress.

There 's no guaranteen that I will finish this project -- to let it came to life.
